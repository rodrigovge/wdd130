    <h2>Rodrigo Vidal Gonzalez Echegoyen</h2>
    <h2>Ruy</h2>
    <p>My name is Rodrigo and I'm currently majoring in Applied Technology at BYU Idaho. 
        I love spending time with my family, watching movies and listening to music.
        I'm married to a wonderful woman named Fiorela, we have a 4-month-old baby and we love this new stage of learning as parents.</p> 
    <p>I'm currently working as a Registry Operator at Llama.pe, when I finish this degree I will be able to work programming or developing with code to have an extra income.</p>
    <p>BYU-Idaho offers high-quality education and also spiritual studies, I love it! 
        Also, the advantages I see from learning about careers in web design is to develop a creative mind in search of solutions. 
        I want to be a Full Stack Web Developer and I'm so exited to learn more abut programming and work with code.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since 2014, I served as a full-time missionary at El Salvador, San Salvador East Mission 2015 - 2017.</p> 
    <p>My favorite scripture is Mosiah 2:17 
        "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; 
        that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God." 
        It always reminds me that I must be ready to help and serve others following the example of my savior Jesus Christ.</p>
        
    <p>Glad to meet you all :).</p>
